Early Childhood Music Class Search

Name possibilities:
  1. My Little Musician

What do I want a user to be able to do?

      a. neighborhoods or geolocation?
      b. age
      c. day of the week (morning or afternoon)
      d. accompanied or drop-off?
  2. see seleciton of music classes adhering to filters
  3. click links for music class to be redirected to that school's website

  (4.) Allow user(a school) to request to be included in search

What information do I need to scrape?
  1. class name
  2. age range
  3. day/time
  4. neighborhood (or should I use geolocation?)
  5. accompanied or drop-off?

How will I set up scraper?
  1. set up individual scraper for each school
  2. will that really save me more time than creating the database myself?
  3. is this a stupid idea?!

Maybe try by manually building database first?
